            <p>In the winter quarter of HCDE, we got an opportunity to conduct usability testing on HTC-Under Armour's latest Health and Fitness kit, the HealthBox. The project was a part of the Usability Study course.</p>

                    <p>HealthBox is a system of connected devices that works to monitor, measure & manage health and fitness. The system includes a smart band, a digital weighing scale & a heart rate monitor device, all centrally connected to UA’s Record app. The goal of our project was to conduct a usability study of the HealthBox system and report the findings to HTC & Under Armour.
                        <br>
                        <br> After discussing with the client & doing primary research on social forums, we narrowed down our study focus on two areas of the HealthBox: The Onboarding process and the Fitness mode of the UA Band.
                        <br>
                        <br> We conducted the test with 10 participants, 4 for the on boarding and 6 for the UA Band test. Participants liked the hardware & the industrial design of the HealthBox system. They also liked the interfaces of the UA Band and the UA Record app. On the other side, re-connection issues and certain navigational and visual inconsistencies posed a challenge to their experience. </p>

                    We started using the devices to familiarize with the system. We then created an interaction map for the above two processes to get a clear understanding about the user interface and interaction. We brainstormed several ideas to identify the best way to visually convey the setup process of the HealthBox system and the Fitness part of the UA Band. After several iterations, we were able to come with the final interaction map.

                    We learned that 65%-70% of Under Armour's users used iPhones and they were the primary target audience. We also wanted to conduct the study with people who exercised regularly and didn't have any health concerns like having implanted pacemakers or pregnency.
                    <br>
                    <br> For recruiting the participants, we used a Google form survey and word-of-mouth methods. Out of 70 survey respondents, we picked 7 and the other 3 through word-of-mouth. We did the entire recruiting in 3 days.

However, as we conducted the Onboarding tests, we realised that we didn't learn anything new beyond the 4 participants and hence shifted the 5th Onboarding participant to the UA Band - Fitness mode study.

However, they didn't notice that the interface had an infinite scroll and all participants swiped towards the right and felt it took them extra effort to reach the fitness screen.

                    While we were happy with the way we conducted the study, there were still several aspects of the study that we could’ve done better. The short time we had to conduct the test was one of the major reasons. Also, since this was our first shot at a formal usability study, we noticed several inconsistencies and shortcomings in our study plan:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We could test with only 1 participant from age group of 30-46 since only one participant matched our criteria out of the . </li>
                        <li>We could not test the UA Band in outdoor conditions due to logistic limitations.</li>
                        <li>We spotted issues in the study kit and we kept improving it as we progressed through the studies. Although our findings were pretty consistent across all studies, the testing experience could have been better for the early participants.</li>
                        <li>Participants said they could understand the band’s interaction much better over a period of time. Some of the issues we discovered could just have been a learnability issue. Conducting a longitudinal study over a longer period of time would have helped us understand those issues better. </li>
                    </ul>

                    The usability study of the HTC HealthBox was an amazing learning experience. Coming into the course, I had a general idea about what usability testing was, but the course helped me gain in-depth knowledge of usability studies. The theory, discussions and the hands-on tests we conducted really reinforced the right approaches to conduct a study and gave me more confidence in being able to conduct a professional usability study.
                    <br>
                    <br> The study in itself was a success. We were able to carry out tests with a good mix of participants with varying backgrounds and ethnicities. We discovered many things that participants liked about the product that we didn’t expect. From the tests we also discovered certain areas of improvements in the product which can improve the overall experience for the users. We hope our work over the course of the quarter would be useful for HTC and Under Armour and help them in ironing out the wrinkles in the existing version and create an experience that delights its users.
