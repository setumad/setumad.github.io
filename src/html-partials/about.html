				<!-- I started working on UX design even before I knew what UX design was. In 2012, when I was working for a new project, I was getting annoyed by the lack of a tool to keep a record of the data that was being generated. I decided to fix the problem for myself by creating a simple excel-based tool.having started with no programming experince, the tool later evolved and became DailyRecord, a tool that efficiently managed the data of the entire team, created beautiful reports and ost importantly, made the lives of my colleagues simpler than before. <br> <br> 

				Developing that tool helped me realise that I love to understand people's problems & find solutions for them and I loved to explore and learn new things on my quest to solve those problems. <br> <br> 

				Soon after, much against the will of my parents, I quit my regular job to chase my dreams. It was scary at first, but luckily I met some amazing people on the way and although I was not earning any money, I was earning a lot of knowledge wealth. I had the great fortune of co-founding two startups with my friends focusing on Advanced Learning Methods in Education (The Next Chapter) and an Online Events Marketplace (Eventosaur technologies Pvt Ltd).<br> <br> 

				I started falling more in love with UX design as I went further along in my adventure. There was something special about listening to people, observing their behaviour, identifying problems and ideating solutions to solve them. It was very exciting and I wanted to dive deeper. And that urge to learn brought me to The University of Washington's Human Centered Design and Engineering (HCDE) where I'm currently pursuing the Master's program. <br> <br> 

				The last couple years have been the most amazing time of my life. I met wonderful people and traveled to some amazing places all the while learning new things constantly like Entrepreneurship, User Research and Usability studies, Prototyping and Design. I even learned how to build webistes while building this portfolio website. <br> <br> --> 





				<!-- I got into UX design much before I knew what UX design is when I first created the DailyRecord tool. It was a time when I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to do in life and developing this tool to solve a real problem and see it bring a positive change in the users’ lives was a very satisfying discovery of my passion.<br> <br> 

				From that moment I never looked back. Creating tools and products that improves people’s lives is what I enjoyed doing and what I wanted to work on. I quit my previous job in the pursuit of my passion and was fortunate enough to find some very exciting people on my journey who supported me. I got an opportunity to co-found two start-ups each trying to solve a specific social problem.<br> <br> 

				I love UX for one reason. It gives me an opportunity to learn and discover new skills and technologies. More importantly helps me understand people and their behaviour. Every design challenge is a new opportunity to learn something new. Be it learning about statistical analysis or skecthing or even how to build websites such as this portfolio. And this is what makes me look forward to every Monday morning. -->





				It all started in 2012 when I found myself in a new project for Vodafone UK while I was at Ericsson. The project was new and there wasn't a lot of processes and standards in place to keep a track of the data we (My teammates & myself) were generating and reporting. We were getting it done on loose sheets of paper and post-it notes and that would annoy me. So I started building something for myself that would make my life easier. I soon realised that my colleagues faced the same annoyances as I did and soon enough, I was spending more time designing the tool than on the actual work, because I was enjoying talking to my 'target users', empathising their problems, and coming up with a solution. The tool, the Daily Record, along with another tool that automatically generated scripts, were judged as the <b>best innovation of the year at Ericsson</b> and that was my moment of epiphany. <br> <br>

				I understood that I enjoyed understanding people's problems and coming up with solutions for them. But I didn't know how to make that my career. So I decided to venture out of the comfort zone and discover my passion. I then quit my job and turned down an admit from an American university to pursue master's in computer networking, much against my parents' wishes, because that was not where my passion lied. <br> <br>

				Soon in the process of self-discovery, I met some amazing people and had the great opportunity to co-found two start-ups with them. The more I got closer to interacting with users & talking to them about their problems, the more I starting liking this work which I learned was being called as UX. I then decided to study and learn more about this subject and pursue master's studies in it. Luckily enough, I got an opportunity to study at one of the best places to study human centered design, the Human Centered Design and Engineering program at the University of Washington. <br> <br>

				Currently I'm in my first year of the Master's program and this is probably the best phase of my life. I have learned more stuff about User Research, usability studies, design and entrepreneurship in the last 4 months that I have ever learned in the past. <br> <br>

				UX design has been a great revelation for me, for the fact that it gives me an opportunity to learn and discover new skills and technologies.  More importantly, it helps me understand people and their behaviour. <b>Every design challenge is a new opportunity to learn something new</b>. Be it learning about statistical analysis or skecthing or learning about new typefaces or even learning how to build websites such as this portfolio. It has been a great journey from quitting a job without knowing what to do next to being at a place where I look forward to the every next Monday.
