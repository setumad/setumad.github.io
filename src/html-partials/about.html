		I'm Setu, a graduate student at the department of Human Centered Design & Engineering at the University of Washington. In the past I have worked on several projects designing tools and services that have simplified the users lives. I'm passionate about User Research, Usability Studies and Interaction Design and with my varying skills in user reserach, web development, prototyping and design, I look forward to solving more problems.

		<p id="introduction">MY STORY</p>
	</div>
		<div class="storycontent">

			My debut into the world of human-centered software design happened serendipitously at Ericsson where I joined as a network design engineer. I self-initiated two software-design projects to improve my teamâ€™s performance using context-aware algorithms and automation. The tools drastically streamlined the database management process of the team, saved significant time and reduced human errors. 
			The tool <a href="dailyrecord.html">'The Daily Record'</a> was judged as the <b>best innovation of the year at Ericsson</b> and that was my moment of epiphany. <br> <br>

			I realized that I enjoyed understanding people's problems and coming up with solutions for them. Soon in the process of self-discovery, I met some amazing people and had the great opportunity to co-found two start-ups with them. The more I got closer to interacting with users & talking to them about their problems, the more I started liking UX Design. With an aim to learn the principles of human centered design in depth, I joined the Human Centered Design and Engineering program at the University of Washington. <br> <br>

			I love UX Design, for the fact that it gives me an opportunity to learn and discover new skills and technologies.  More importantly, it helps me understand people and their behaviour. <b>Every design challenge is a new opportunity to learn something new</b>. Be it learning about statistical analysis or skecthing or learning about new typefaces or even learning how to build websites such as this portfolio. Although we live in a very advanced world, it's still far from perfect and the challenges we face is what motivates me and makes me look forward to  every next Monday.
