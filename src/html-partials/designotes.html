					<p>Changed the UW-ISE content layout from a standard picture-content-picture to a more dynamic and playful layout. This makes the reading experience better on big screens. I also learned a new way to handle CSS for the content. Previously I had added individual CSS styles for every content box. I realised making things global would make my life so easy. I created a bunch of templates for every content style and I simply had to plug in text and images in subsequent content boxes.</p>

					<p>Showers are so awesome! I got this wonderful idea when I was taking a shower this morning to make the content card based. I liked the way I had used grey and white boxes to separate content so that it doesn't seem too monotonous for the readers. But I realised that the layout itself seemed to be hanging in the screen without any structure. That's when I thought using a card based for the content. Now this gives a more structured visual guide for the reader even though the text & images within the cards have a varying structure. Now the readers know exactly how long a content box is and hopefully have a better reading experience. So greatful for Google's Material Design language. <br><br> So far I have implemented this design to the UW-ISE project. I should now make this consistent across all the other projects and pages. </p>

					<p>In the last few weeks I'm learning a lot of new things in web design thanks to my Visual Communication course at HCDE and a bunch of books I'm reading on designing better, user friendly websites. However as I was making these changes, I realised that I do not have a log to keep a track of the changes. Although everything I do is getting backed-up in GitHub, it does not tell why I made those changes or what my rationale was when I did them. That's when I realised that I need to have some sort of a blog where I can keep a log of all the design/content changes/additions I make, which will help me in the future when I want to know why I did something. Also, it's a good way to see how I've progressed. <br><br>And hence, Design Notes. </p>
