                <article class="contentcenter ideacontent">

                    <p>The idea first started out as a map-centric dating app where people would carry out activities that makes them unique and add them on a map. The app would then recommend other people doing similar activities. However after getting feedback from my peers, I learned that people were less open to the map centric idea and I iterated it to a more activity centric idea. </p>

            <h2 class="sectionheader">Challenges faced</h2>
            <article class="contentcenter">
                <p>Some of the main challenges I faced during this project:
                    <br>
                    <br>1. <span class="boldtext">Choosing the right navigation pattern</span> - Each screen presented different information. It took me a while to study and implement navigation structure across every page that would not be comfusing to the users.
                    <br>
                    <br>2. <span class="boldtext">Choosing the right platform to build the prototype</span> - I tried to create the prototype using Axure, Flinto and Framer before settling with Framer as code-based tool gave me the most flexibility to prototype. However the tool soon got very resource intensive and the process got very slow, and I had to eventually compromise on complicated interactions.
                    <br>
                    <br>3. <span class="boldtext">Creating animations</span> - I wanted to explore some level of animations for transitions and other interactions where animations help in communicating the content better (Eg: Pictures expanding into full screen). Unfortunately due to the lack of time, I wasn't able to explore this part.
                </p>

        <section id="container" class="reflectionbox">
            <h2 class="sectionheader">Reflections</h2>
            <article class="contentcenter">
                <p>During this exercise I got some much needed hand-on experince in designing interactions for a mobile app and the dating app context was a very interesting one as I don’t use a dating app. Before designing, I had to learn how dating apps work, read about popular dating apps and their evolution over time to get a better understanding of the context. With the limited time I had, I could not explore all the possible interactions and screen beyond what is possible in the prototype. On the whole, I wanted to explore new ways to create a dating app and I am happy I was able to create this prototype. In the further interations I would like to:
                    <br>
                    <br>1. Have a detailed profile set-up page and integration with other social media profiles.
                    <br>
                    <br>2. Explore other tools for prototyping animations, transitions and interactions to provide better affrodances. This is something I would like to work more on. .
                    <br>
                    <br>3. Consider more enagagement ideas - Additional ways to keep users hooked to the app and get more incentives for staying on it.
