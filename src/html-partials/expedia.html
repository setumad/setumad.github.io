                    <p>Expedia’s website lets users shop for hotel rooms from a choice of multiple hotels based on the destination. However, when users require two or more rooms, they cannot pick and choose rooms of their choice or customize their bed types. During my Summer (2016) internship at Expedia, I was tasked with exploring ways to provide a better hotel shopping experience by letting users customize their beds and occupancy configurations while booking hotel rooms.</p>

                        <li>Help users shop for different hotel rooms and rates in the same booking session.</li>

                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>On an average 6 out of 10 people chose 2 or more rooms when shopping for hotel rooms for themselves and their family & friends</li>
                    <li>Users want to be able to search or ﬁlter based on their preferred bed type</li>
                    <li>Bed type is the highest reason for customer calls</li>

            <div>
                <article class="contentcenter">Working with a team of very smart and talented designers was a great experience for me. This was the first time I was working with a design team and a product this large and I was able to understand the nuances of working in such conditions. Some of my takeaways are:
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Focusing on the problem and the users while designing.</li>
                        <li>Creating multiple variants of the same design to explore different design possibilities and comparing them with each other to find the most appropriate solution.</li>
                        <li>Asking yourself a lot of ‘Why’s while designing helps get to the problem faster and stay focused on the same.</li>
                        <li>Attention to detail - Thinking about the purpose behind a design, how it would affect a user's decision making process. Design should help reduce confusion in users' minds and help them get to their goals faster. </li>
                        <li>Designing for accessibility - Accessibility is a huge factor while designing interactions. All possible users and their limitations must be considered & the design should help everyone achieve their goals equally easily. </li>

            <article class="contentcenter">
                <ul>
                    <li>Work with a team of at least 2 or 3 members so that the research phase can be done faster and generate a broader set of ideas. Being the only person in the team, it was a challenge to handle all the processes of UX for a project of this magnitude.</li>
                    <li>Get a better understanding of the business and accessibility limitations before designing. In this project there were certain design patterns that had accessibility concerns due to which I had to redesign some elements and explore different patterns.</li>
