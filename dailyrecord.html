								<p>The Story Behind The Tool</p>

							<div class="content">
								<p>A project I started working in was in its early stages and job related data records were being maintained in notebooks and loose sheets of paper. It was not efficient, both in terms of time spent and use of paper.
									<br>
									<br> There was no uniformity in the way data was being maintained. Due to the lack of a software program or a common process defined to store information, every person in the team maintained data individually. This caused a lot of problems when data
									had to be shared between team members and between the leads and the team members.
									<br>
									<br> This was causing me great discomfort. I felt like I was spending too much time talking to people than getting work done. To solve that problem, and keep my work organized I created a simple tool on MS Excel. And that eventually evolved into
									DataRecord, a sophisticated tool that handled the database of the entire team.

								<p>Yours truly was the first subject I researched on to understand the problems. And most of the problems I faced were also being faced by other members of the team. Some of the problems were:
									<br>
									<br> &#9679 No centralized mechanism to record and maintain data related to the work.
									<br> &#9679 Post-it notes were getting lost more frequently than we wanted, more when we had to report our data to the managers.
									<br> &#9679 We spent more time consolidating data and discussing them with the managers than was necessary leading to confusion and frustration.
									<br> &#9679 Solutions to problems by one person was not accessible by all team members - Same problems were being troubleshooted from scratch by multiple people.

								<p>The research involved <span class="boldtext">Observing people while they work </span>and <span class="boldtext">User interviews</span>. Early in the development process, I borrowed my colleagues' notes and post-its to understand how they record
									their data. I also spoke to my colleagues and enquired about their specific frustrations with the existing system.
									<br>
									<br>
									<h2 class="boldtext">Findings</h2> From the research I understood that:
									<br>
									<br> &#9679 By observing the notes people took down, I found out that although people used a lot of information during work, they only made a note of a few important bits. With this data I understood what information is most used and most frequently
									accessed/updated and put that on top in the design.
									<br> &#9679 I also understood that people hated filling excel sheets. Upon further enquiry, I came to know that it's not the software they hated, but it's the amount of data they had to manually enter. I also realised that they were averse to using
									a new software as they were already used to using excel and used it very frequently. Making an excel-based tool as less intrusive as possible by making it smart was my next big challenge.</p>

								<p>I wanted to create a tool which did not consume too much time, and yet was intuitive enough to maintain and handle all the information related to the project. I envisioned the following features:
									<br>
									<br> &#9679 Maintain all the data related to the project automatically.
									<br> &#9679 Create reports automatically summarizing the weekly work data, so that I didn't have to do that manually every week.
									<br> &#9679 Keep a record of all the issues faced by all the team mates with respective solutions so that we didn't have to reinvent the wheel every time the issue repeated.

								<p>After developing the first version of the product, I conducted a beta usability testing. I conducted a mix of <span class="boldtext">Open ended usability tests</span> and <span class="boldtext">Specific use-case tests</span>. I observed how users
									interacted with the tool. These studies revealed several bugs and loopholes. Some of them are:
									<br>
									<br> &#9679 The interface was cluttered with information and it wasn't easy to scroll between columns.
									<br> &#9679 Making reports of weekly activities was still taking a lot of time.
									<br> &#9679 This version did not have features to allow scheduling of future work.

							<div class="content">
								<p>Based on the data collected from the usability studies, I went back to the drawing board and added some new features and performance improvements which made the tool almost twice as fast and more efficient than the first version. Some of the improvements
									included:
									<br>
									<br> &#9679 The collapse buttons made the interface much cleaner and presented information in an easy-to-read format.
									<br>
									<br> &#9679 Weekly reports could be easily generated with the press of a button, thus saving significant amount of time.
									<br>
									<br> &#9679 The new scheduler function would remind the user of any activity scheduled on that particular day.
									<br>
									<br>
									<br> By incorporating a lot of automation and context-aware algorithms, I was able to make the tool 'smarter'. It consumed very less user- time and yet maintained all the necessary information related to multiple activities and their progress.

								<p> In the end a user had to click at the most 3-4 buttons and fill in 3-4 fields. The tool automatically took care of organising and maintaining the work of the user.
									<br>
									<br> As much as 90% of database management time and human errors were saved.
									<br>
									<br> The Weekly Report function made it very easy for the users to keep a track of their activity and submit reports by the end of the week.
									<br>
									<br> The managers and leads found it very convinient to monitor the progress of the activities using the Combined Report.
									<br>
									<br> It eliminated use of papers thereby being ecofriendly.

								<p>I started developing the tool with no prior software design experience. As I progressed, I learnt the immense possibilities of product design and gained skills like user centered design, programming and product development cycle from the stage
									of conceptualization to the final delivery.
									<br>
									<br> User centric approach was an important learning since I was working with a team of different individuals with unique work roles and mindsets.
									<br>
									<br>
									<div class="hugetext">"I learned that defining and approaching the problem is more important than the platform to solve it"</div>
									<br>
									<br> As per Ericsson's internal cost saving calculations, the projected savings in cost amounted to close to $1m/year.
									<br>
									<br> The tool was adjudged one of the 'Best Innovation of the year' during an internal-Ericsson 'Innovation Week' event.
									<br>
									<br> Most importantly, I learned that a design problem can be solved by a tool as inconspicuous as MS Excel.I learned that defining and approcahing the problem is more important than the platform to solve it.
