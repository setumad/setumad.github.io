							<div class="content">
								<p>A project I started working in was in its early stages and job related data records were being maintained in notebooks and loose sheets of paper. It was not efficient, both in terms of time spent and use of paper.
									<br>
									<br> There was no uniformity in the way data was being maintained. Due to the lack of a software program or a common process defined to store information, every person in the team maintained data individually. This caused a lot of problems when data
									had to be shared between team members and between the leads and the team members.
									<br>
									<br> This was causing me great discomfort. I felt like I was spending too much time talking to people than getting work done. To solve that problem, and keep my work organized I created a simple tool on MS Excel. And that eventually evolved into
									DataRecord, a sophisticated tool that handled the database of the entire team.

									<br>
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li> No centralized mechanism to record and maintain data related to the work.</li>
									<br>
									<li> Post-it notes were getting lost more frequently than we wanted, more when we had to report our data to the managers.</li>
									<br>
									<li> We spent more time consolidating data and discussing them with the managers than was necessary leading to confusion and frustration.</li>
									<br>
									<li> Solutions to problems by one person was not accessible by all team members - Same problems were being troubleshooted from scratch by multiple people.</li>

								<p>The research involved <span class="boldtext">Observing people while they work </span>and <span class="boldtext">User interviews</span>. Early in the development process, I borrowed my colleagues' notes and post-its to understand how they record
									their data. I also spoke to my colleagues and enquired about their specific frustrations with the existing system.

									<br>
								</p>
								<h2 class="boldtext">Findings</h2> From the research I understood that:
								<br>
								<br>
								<ul>
									<li> By <b>observing</b> the notes people took down, I found out that although people used a lot of information during work, they only made a note of a few important bits. With this data I understood what information is most used and most frequently
										accessed/updated and put that on top in the design.</li>
									<br>
									<li> I understood that people hated filling excel sheets. Upon further enquiry, I came to know that it's not the software they hated, but it's the amount of data they had to manually enter.</li>
									<br>
									<li>I also realised that they were averse to using a new software as they were already used to using excel and used it very frequently. </li>
									<br> </ul> Making an excel-based tool as less intrusive as possible by making it smart was my next big challenge. </div>

										<li> The interface was cluttered with information and it wasn't easy to scroll between columns.</li>
										<br>
										<li> Making reports of weekly activities was still taking a lot of time.</li>

									<br>
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li> The collapse buttons made the interface much cleaner and presented information in an easy-to-read format.
										<br>
										<br>
									</li>
									<li> Weekly reports could be easily generated with the press of a button, thus saving significant amount of time.
										<br>
										<br>
									</li>
									<li> The new scheduler function would remind the user of any activity scheduled on that particular day.
										<br>
										<br>
										<br>
									</li>
								</ul> By incorporating a lot of automation and context-aware algorithms, I was able to make the tool 'smarter'. It consumed very less user- time and yet maintained all the necessary information related to multiple activities and their progress.

								<p>I started developing the tool with no prior software design experience. As I progressed, I learnt the immense possibilities of product design and gained skills like user centered design, programming and product development cycle from the stage
									of conceptualization to the final delivery.
									<br>
									<br> User centric approach was an important learning since I was working with a team of different individuals with unique work roles and mindsets.
