						<div class="storycontent"> I got into UX design much before I knew what UX design is when I first created the DailyRecord tool. It was a time when I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to do in life and developing this tool to solve a real problem and see it bring
							a positive change in the users’ lives was a very satisfying discovery of my passion.
							<br>
							<br> From that moment I never looked back. Creating tools and products that improves people’s lives is what I enjoyed doing and what I wanted to work on. I quit my previous job in the pursuit of my passion and was fortunate enough to find some very
							exciting people on my journey who supported me. I got an opportyunity to co-found two start-ups each trying to solve a specific social problem.
							<br>
							<br> I love UX for one reason. It gives me an opportunity to learn and discovering new skills and technologies. And more importantly helps me understand people and their behaviour. Every design challenge is a new opportunity to learn something new
							and this is what makes me look forward to every Monday morning.
